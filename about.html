    <p>This website's purpose is to give the community awareness that animal cruelty is still imminent in all forms today and that many organizations can help our furry friends. Organizations exist to prevent such inhumane actions, help our furry friends be free from pain, fear, and suffering, and promote society to act right, to be compassionate and merciful. As stewards of God's creation, we are tasked to protect all the entities living here on Earth; thus, let us fight for the rights of our furry friends and promote a cruelty-free environment!
        The creator of this website is an animal lover, a "cat" lover to be exact, thus having a soft heart for all animals who are not given a chance to live freely and happily just like her pets at home.  &#9829
