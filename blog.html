        <td width = 150>According to PETA, every year, billions of animals suffer and die for clothing and accessories. 
            Skin is torn from them to make leather, birds are held down while handfuls of feathers are ripped out of their sensitive skin, and small animals are caged for life before being killed for their fur. Sheep are often beaten and mutilated by workers stealing their wool and their skin for shearling. Goats are similarly abused for cashmere and mohair. All this is done in the name of fashion. 
            No matter the type of material or where it comes from, it involves horrific cruelty if the process affects an animal.
            The brands that support the use the animal cruelty are the following:
            <b>Hermes, Christian Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs</b></th>
