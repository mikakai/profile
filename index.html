<h2 class = "text_heading">&#x2738 What is the ISSUE?</h2>

<p>Animal cruelty is a crucial social issue because it is witnessed and evident in our daily lives and affects and involves animals, people, and society. It is a must to be aware of the issue because, unlike violent crimes against people, instances and cases of animal abuse are not often compiled by state or federal agencies, making it difficult to find out how common animal cruelty is as media reports tell that animal cruelty is expected in rural and urban places across social and economic boundaries.
   <br> <br> Animal cruelty is about maltreatment, failure, or neglect to give the animals basic needs, love, and care they deserve. It falls into several categories: animal abuse, exploitation, neglect, testing, and human predation. Intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence against people. Those who tend to hurt others, such as their own families, tend to start abusing an animal or a pet. 
    The FBI considers animal cruelty a “Crime Against Society” with the following definition, “Crimes Against Society, e.g., gambling, prostitution, and drug violations, including animal cruelty, represent society’s prohibition against engaging in certain types of activity; they are typically victimless crimes in which property is not the object.”

<h2 class = "text_heading_2">&#x2738 Is it HAPPENING here?</h2>

<p class = "column_B_2">In the Philippines, while some pets and animals are cared for and loved by people, there are also pets (1/3 or even more of them!) that are kept in conditions of abuse, neglect, and sadness in developed countries be grounds for prosecution. As a matter of fact, according to the Philippines Daily Inquirer, 300,000 dogs were recorded as killed every year due to animal cruelty. 
<br> <br> In addition, PAWS executive director Anna Cabrera stated that the organization receives an average of 40 calls daily concerning valid cases of animal abuse due to animal cruelty and neglect.
To stop and fight against the issue, the Philippines has a law called the Animal Welfare Act of 1988, also known as the Republic Act of 8485, a law to protect and promote animal welfare. There are also volunteer-based and non-government organizations like AKF (Animal Foundation Kingdom) and PAWS (Philippine Animal Welfare Society). This organization provides help and care for animals to prevent animal cruelty. 
<br> <br> Animal cruelty can take place anytime and anywhere; hence, let us all spread awareness regarding the issue, and together, let’s make a change as we take a step to reduce and stop animal cruelty.

<h2 class = "text_heading">&#x2738 What are these FORMS?</h2>

<p>People tend to abuse animals with the mindset that they are dominant and superior to animals since human beings are established as the one who has the free will to do so. Occurrences of animal cruelty are evident globally and locally, in the wildlife and even in the four walls of one’s house. An average homeowner or pet owner who tolerates the action of animal abuse or neglect can never be prosecuted or even called out, as animal cruelty is usually legal and common in some countries. Unfortunately, most cases are not even justified nor reported, which should make us more aware and participate in social change as we use our voices to speak up and demand accountability for these animals.
    Most cases of animal abuse involve the practice of voluntarily harming animals. 
    <br><br>Instances like kicking, chaining, or caging an animal or pet can already be considered animal abuse in developed countries, which many people are unaware of. Animal cruelty includes practices like testing products on animals which makes them exposed to possibly harmful chemicals and substances that may lead to terrible and dangerous consequences on animals, keeping animals in a zoo depriving them of their freedom and rights, predation of animals like the dog-eating festival, the cruelty in fur farming industry where animals are violently killed just for use in fashion, and such which is accountable for the act of animal abuse.
